## Ulam's Spiral
Discovered by Stanislaw Ulam while doodling in a math conference in 1963, Ulam's Spiral is a way of visualizing prime numbers. 

Written by Jesse Lieman-Sifry while looking for interesting projects during the Summer of 2015, ulamsSpiral.py generates prime numbers up to a user-specified number, figures out which of those are have a neighbor two away (11 and 13, for example), then plots them. A few different size outputs/configs are included in this repository. 

Below is the version with all primes visualized as white pixels.

In this version, any primes that have a neighbor prime (two away) are visualized as orange pixels.
