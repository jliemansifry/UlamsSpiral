## Ulams Spiral
Discovered by Stanislaw Ulam while doodling in a math conference in 1963, Ulam's Spiral is a way of visualizing prime numbers. 
Written by Jesse Lieman-Sifry while looking for interesting projects during the summer of 2015, ulamsSpiral.py generates prime numbers up to a user-specified number, figures out which of those are have a neighbor two away (11 and 13, for example), then plots them.
